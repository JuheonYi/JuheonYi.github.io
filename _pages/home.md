<!-- * [[CV](https://juheonyi.github.io/files/JuheonYi_CV.pdf)] (last updated: 2025.03)  -->

I am a senior researcher at Microsoft Research Asia. My research focuses on designing futuristic video analytics apps, analyzing their workloads, and building mobile/edge and networked AI systems to support them. Current projects include:

* Live video analytics system design on MEC and Open-RAN
* Edge AI systems for AR/VR/MR
* Media AI Agents

Prior to joining Microsoft, I was a research scientist at Nokia Bell Labs, Cambridge, UK. I received PhD in CS from Seoul National University (SNU), Korea, advised by [Youngki Lee](http://youngkilee.blogspot.com/). [My thesis](https://juheonyi.github.io/files/thesis_juheon_yi.pdf) introduced edge-cloud cooperative platform for live video analytics apps, and was awarded the Best PhD Dissertation Award from the Department of CS, SNU. My PhD study was supported by the [Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/fellowships-microsoft-research-asia/#!fellows).
I received BS and MS in EE from SNU, advised by [Sunghyun Choi](https://sites.google.com/view/sunghyun-chois-home).
