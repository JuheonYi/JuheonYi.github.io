[[CV](https://juheonyi.github.io/files/JuheonYi_CV.pdf)] (last updated: June 2020)

I am a researcher in the Institute of Computer Technology at Seoul National University, Korea. I am currently serving my alternative compulsory military service (started since Nov. 2018). I will start my Ph.D. degree at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University in Sep. 2020. I received my B.S. and M.S. degree from the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Seoul National University in 2016 and 2018 (advisor: [Sunghyun Choi](https://sites.google.com/view/sunghyun-chois-home) ). My research interests include Augmented Reality (AR) and mobile/embedded deep learning systems. I am currently working closely with Prof. [Youngki Lee](http://youngkilee.blogspot.com/).
