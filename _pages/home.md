[[CV](https://juheonyi.github.io/files/JuheonYi_CV.pdf)] (last updated: Nov 2020)

I am a Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Youngki Lee](http://youngkilee.blogspot.com/) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Korea. My research interests lie in Mixed Reality (MR) and mobile deep learning systems. Specifically, my research goal is to design futuristic MR apps, comprehensively analyze their workloads, and build novel enabling mobile systems to support them. I am a recipient of the Microsoft Research Asia Ph.D. Fellowship 2020 (awarded to top 12 students in the Asia-Pacific region).

Prior to my Ph.D. course, I worked at two research institutes at Seoul National University for my military service. I received my B.S. and M.S. degree from the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Seoul National University in 2016 and 2018 (advisor: Dr. [Sunghyun Choi](https://sites.google.com/view/sunghyun-chois-home), now at Samsung Research, Korea).
