[[CV](https://juheonyi.github.io/files/JuheonYi_CV.pdf)] (last updated: Dec. 2021)

I am a Ph.D. student advised by [Youngki Lee](http://youngkilee.blogspot.com/) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Korea. My research interests lie in Mixed Reality (MR) and mobile/edge AI systems. Specifically, my research goal is to design futuristic MR apps, comprehensively analyze their workloads, and build core mobile systems to support them. I am a recipient of the [Microsoft Research Asia Ph.D. Fellowship 2020](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/fellowships-microsoft-research-asia/#!fellows) (awarded to top 12 students in the Asia-Pacific region).

Prior to my Ph.D. course, I worked at two research institutes in Seoul National University for my military service. I received my B.S. and M.S. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University in 2016 and 2018 (advisor: [Sunghyun Choi](https://sites.google.com/view/sunghyun-chois-home), now at Samsung Research, Korea).
