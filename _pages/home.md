[[CV](https://juheonyi.github.io/files/JuheonYi_CV.pdf)] (last updated: Jan. 2025)

I am a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research Asia. My research interests lie in edge AI systems and video analytics. Specifically, I design futuristic video analytics apps, analyze their workloads, and build mobile/edge and networked systems to support them. Current projects include:

* Mixed Reality systems
* On-device AI systems
* Network-compute co-design for video analytics

Prior to joining Microsoft, I was a research scientist at Nokia Bell Labs, Cambridge, UK. I received my PhD in CS from Seoul National University (SNU), Korea, advised by [Youngki Lee](http://youngkilee.blogspot.com/) (awarded Best PhD Dissertation Award). My PhD study has been supported by the [Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/fellowships-microsoft-research-asia/#!fellows) (awarded to top 12 students in the Asia-Pacific region).
I received BS and MS degrees in EE from SNU, advised by [Sunghyun Choi](https://sites.google.com/view/sunghyun-chois-home).
